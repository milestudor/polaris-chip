  <p>Man oh man. Terry Mclaurin, this man has actually been keeping me going for years now. I'm glad I was able to finally see my favorite receiver get a quarterback who can show everyone what Terry really can do. Shoutout Terry Mclaurin man.</p></my-card>

  <p>My good man Zach Ertz. Former Eagle, so him being on a Washington team makes it all the more sweet for me. I knew he was old coming into the season, but he showed everyone that he still got some left in the tank.</p></my-card>

  <p>This is Frankie Luvu, a former member of the carolina panthers. Prior to this season, I was somewhat aware of luvu's game and how good he was, leading me to hyping him up all offseason. Not only did he shatter my expectations, but he also shattered my bank account after I got his jersey!</p></my-card>

  link="https://www.washingtonfootball.com/team/players-roster/bobby-wagner/">
  <p>This is Bobby Wagner, a vital member of the seahawks legion of boom squad that has since found himself in the shackles of Washington. However, this year he proved that uncs still got it and that Washington is very much alive.</p></my-card>
